** cmake and repo structure proposal
   https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/basics/structure.html

   use "modern" cmake
   move all detection and framework "libs" to the same folder: libs
   products => apps?
   invert current split of inc, src and test and make every lib self contained

   inc => include
   no separate folder for private headers

   *.h => *.hpp ? Who cares?

   Limit the amount of "subdirectory" CMakeLists.txt files, does not work well with QtCreator

** code style
   create and force style options

   filenames lowercase or camelcase?

   member variable naming? (don't really care)
